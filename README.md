Hello my name is John and i am doing some edits in this file.
I am learning GitHub to provide my work more efficent and organized.
You should see my prjects now. :D It's a mess, but not for long.
I am going to improve it :) becouse i want to start developing in NodeJS, becouse I've heard that it's really fast and scalable framework to build web applications. So hope it helps :).
See you

John :)
